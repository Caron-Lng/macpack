## Notes

- **Minimal Profile**: Essential tools for basic development work
- **Full-Stack Profile**: Everything in Minimal plus comprehensive web, mobile, and DevOps tools
- All packages are installed via Homebrew for consistency and easy management
- GUI applications are installed as Homebrew Casks
- Some packages may have additional dependencies that are automatically handled by Homebrew

## How Profiles and Config Files Work Together

**Config Files** (`config/packages.yml` and `config/casks.yml`):

- Define ALL available packages organized by category
- Serve as the master catalog of tools
- Can be customized to add/remove available options

**Profile Files** (`profiles/minimal.yml` and `profiles/full-stack.yml`):

- Reference specific packages from the config files
- Override which tools actually get installed
- Profiles take precedence over config files

**No Conflicts**: Profiles select FROM the config files, so:

- If a package is in config but not in your chosen profile → NOT installed
- If a package is in your profile but not in config → Installation will fail
- Best practice: Keep config files comprehensive, customize via profiles
